# DiscordBot
A java Discord bot

Note:
To make the bot work, you have to change some stuff in the code:
1. Put your own Discord Bot Token (You can get it from the Discord Developer Portal) in the DiscordBotApplication.java class on line 33.
2. In the JSONHandler.java class change the url for the JSON-Hosting file. You can create your own on https://api.npoint.io
3. In the JSONHandler.java class on line 101 add your own Youtube-Search API-Key, which you can generate on the official website (https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).
